                            <h5>What is a, "Montage Extras?"</h5>
                            <p>A montage extras item is any special function or feature that your project requires that others may not. Not every project needs a montage extras, but most projects have one or two things about them that are not part of every project. If it takes a few extra hours to implement and isn't typical of every website, we call that a montage extras item.</p>
                       </div>
                       
                       <div class="pad_top_25">
                            <h5>Why are they free?</h5>
                            <p>We came up with the idea to include some flexible, added-effort items (aka bells and whistles) with our standard and extended site packages as a way to make sure that we could offer a one-size-fits-all pricing model and also accommodate the wide variety of requirements each project may include.</p>
                            <p>Having free bells and whistles allows us to offer packages that include everything our clients may need, so we don't have to mess with estimating and can jump directly to building great websites.</p>

                            <h5>Can X be a montage extras!</h5>
                            <p>Sure! If we can get it done in 3 hours, it can be a montage extras. The sky is the limit. Want 3 hours of brand consultation? You got it! Want 3 extra hours of training? No problem! It'll take 6 hours, you say? Call it two bells and whistles and we're good to go!</p>
