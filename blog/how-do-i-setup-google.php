                    <ul>
                        <li>The first thing that you need to do is to create your account, then claim your business. This is done by logging onto the Google account you want to have associated with your company. Go to google.com/business and then select the “Start Now” option in the upper right-hand corner. You just need to input your business name where it says, “What’s the Name of Your Business?” Finally, fill out the additional information, like location and delivery area if applicable.</li>
                        <li>After claiming your business, you then need to verify your business on Google. There are a few ways that you can do this, including instant verification, email verification, and by phone. Email verification may not be an option for everyone, so you need to make sure that you have this option. By selecting the way that you want to verify your business, you will get the step-by-step process to complete your verification.</li>
                        <li>Your next step is to optimize your listing. This means that you need to include as much media and information as possible about the business and its amenities. You should make sure that you put the most accurate information about your business in this section. Other people can edit this, so you do need to keep an eye on this in case someone has made your information incorrect.</li>
                        <li>Get the Google My Business app, as this allows you access to your account wherever you are. You can use this to post status updates or updated photos as well as view your search insights to see how well the campaign is working. </li>
                    </ul>
